                The third project of the semester was also based on some of my experiences. I chose to recreate the experience of a really boring road trip. I used concepts from Oulipo. I considered how I could constrain myself when creating my environment and decided to model everything using just the default shapes in Blender. I thought of the fact that the longer a road trip goes on for, the more the environment seems to blend together. I also decided that I would only create the assets for the environment and I would let the computer choose where to put them. A RNG script would choose to spawn in these assets which would move past the car, giving the illusion of movement to the user in the vehicle, and then despawn after going past. This would create an endless ever changing environment that makes it seem like the user is travelling a great distance without it taking up very much space on the computer. There is also another spawner that has a very small chance of  periodically spawning a sheep. This is meant to be a “highlight” in the experience. Something extremely mundane but because it happens so rarely it becomes exciting to witness. I successfully added in emotions through coded variables. The user can click on their surroundings to change them, I added this in because I wanted different sceneries to cycle through, however it drew away from the fact that the user is supposed to feel bored and like they have no control.
